## Section 2 Reflection

#### 1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I think I'm somewhere in between. I tend to be very quick to use google/other digital resources at hand to work through technical difficulties, but I often don't put in the effort to formulate and ask more substantive questions of *human* resources.

I feel pretty uncomfortable asking technical questions of other people, mostly because it feels much faster to look them up. I do recognize, though, that we may get more than we're looking for (in a good way) when we use human beings as a technical resource rather than always turning to google.

#### 1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I enjoyed using outside resources and found the exercise tasks very intuitive, so I honestly didn't notice you had removed any supports until I saw this question.

#### 1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional is an if-then statement, which describes the relationship between two claims/actions for which one is sufficient to the other's being true (or being instructed). According to a conditional, the first part, the antecedent, is sufficient for but not necessary to the truth/carrying out of the second part, the consequent. Hence, the consequent is the *consequence* of the antecedent. The consequent is necessary to but not sufficient for the truth/carrying out of the antecedent.

I continually refer to the "truth" OR "carrying out" of each statement, because
conditionals can describe a relationship of truth values (as they do, for instance, in philosophical logic),
but in programming, their consequents are often *imperatives* for the computer. They tell the computer to make the world fit the conditional, rather than using the conditional to describe what is already true of the world. So, in programming, a conditional statement serves as a qualified instruction: 'do THIS THING given that THIS OTHER THING is true'

Examples -

daily life:
If it rains today, then I will not go on a run.

Web app - google weather search:
If localWeather is assigned to "sunny", then display sun icon.


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.


1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

1. What is a parameter? What is an argument? Why would you use one? Provide an example of a function that accepts an argument (declaration and call), and indicate what the parameter is and what the argument is.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
